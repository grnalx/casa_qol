My standard casa config and startup files with minor quality of life tweaks

The startup file imports the analysisUtils package (found in the home directory)
The config file adapts the config file in the casa docs (https://casadocs.readthedocs.io/en/v6.2.0/api/configuration.html) but moves all the logfiles into a directory named casalogs
